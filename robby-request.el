PROMPT is the complete prompt possibly including conversation history.

BASIC-PROMPT is the prompt string, without any conversation
history.  If HISTORYP is t record complete PROMPT and TEXT
response in history when HTTP request completes.

API is the symbol of the api to use, for example `'chat' or
`'completions'.

OPTIONS is a property list of options to pass to the OpenAI
API. It is merged in with the customization options for the API.

Call CALLBACK with result.  CALLBACK function must be of the
form `(TEXT BEG END), where TEXT is the value returned by OpenAI,
and BEG and END are the bounds of the selected region if any when
the command was invoked."
